  Ummm... ok. Hi!!! I'm Gokou. Got that down? All right. First thing is first.
</p>

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

First thing is a box will appear. Type a name you will be known as. The loading may take awhile. So be patient.

**RULES:**

Please don't trash talk to the people who have an @ before their name. They are more superior. And no flooding. flooding is the use of repeating the dame thing over atleast 5 times.

**WAYS TO GET AROUND:**

Okay... here's away to change your name. In the small little box put: /nick \*put your name here\*. Oh... yeah. No periods or stars that goes for the others ways to get around. If you wanna show a action your doing type this: EXAMPLE: /me is eating. It will appear like this: \* \*Name\* is eating.

Well you got that. If your really good I might make you a +. It's okay... Well your ready.
