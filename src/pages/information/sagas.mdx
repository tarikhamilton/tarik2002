<h3>Buu Saga</h3>

Gohan started school finally. After the 7 years. Gohan now 18 years old and in the Orange Star High School. Chibi Trunks is now 8 years old and now Goten, a baby left by Gokou and Chi-Chi before the battle against Cell. He's 7 and they both secretly Super Saiyjin. Gohan also has a new identity so he could rescue people. He is know known as The Great Saiyaman. Hercules' duaghter, Videl who is a very strong human crime fighter. She don't like this Saiyaman guy. When she figures out who was Saiyaman is, she challenges Gohan in the The World's Martial Arts Tournament. Gokou hears about it. He decides he'll join the tournament. He has one day to go back to Earth. The fights go well. Chibi Trunks won the junior compitition by cheating. In the Adult compitition. Two men, Kibito and Kaioshen. Kaioshen is purple with funny looking things on his head. Kibito was a tall red man with long white hair. He looked very old. I don't really know how old he is. When they figured out Kaioshen was the Supreme kai, they were amazed. Two men, Yamu and Spopovitch were there. They were there to absorb people's power for an evil plan. Later Gohan was up to fight Kibito. Kibito asked to show Gohan to show his true power. Gohan powered up to Super Saiyjin 2. Then Yamo absorbed his energy. Kaioshen told them Gohan will be fine after the injury. Kaioshen went after Yamu and Sopovitch. Gokou and the gang wonder were he is going so they tag along. The tournament never was finished. Since the Z-Fighters flew off after Kaioshen. When they caught up, Kaioshen told him that an Evil Wizard named Bibidi planed an evil plot years ago. He's very weak, but his magic is very strong. He created a monster named Majin Buu. Kaioshen and the North Kai (King Kai) sealed stopped Buu years ago. But they didn't know that Bibidi had a son. His name was Babidi who had Majin Buu and justed needed to gain energy to revive Majin Buu. Later Kibito revives Gohan's energy and he tells the same story. As they reach the site where Yamu ans Sopovitch landed. Supreme Kai tells them he been here before. But they discover the hideout was under ground. They were hiding behind rocks. As Yamu and Spopovitch give the energy from Gohan to Babidi. Babidi decided to kill them. Babidi's magic is so strong, that if you don't have a good heart or your evil. He could turn you to his side. A symbol is marked on their head to represent that they belong to him. It's a little M. It means Majin. The demon king, Dabura was tooken from Hell to be under Babidi's slave. Dabura's very strong. His power level is 35,000,000. That's around Gohan's strength. Gokou and Vegita can beat him. When Babidi killed Yamu and Sopovitch, he find the Z-fighters. Babidi tells Dabura to kill them. Dabura made a fast appearence up to Kibito. With one blast he destroyed him. As soon as Dabura spits on Krillin. Kaioshen worns them about anything Dabura spits on turns to stone. Piccolo was spit on too. Gokou was mad. They decide to go into Babidi's spaceship and destroy the evil Majin Buu. They figured out that there are 3 levels of the ship. They must first fight Pyu-Pyu. The 3 saiyans were wanted to fight Pyu-Pyu. So they played rock, paper, scissors. Vegita won, Gokou is supposed to go second, and Gohan last. Supreme Kai was afraid. He didn't know how strong the Saiyans were. Babidi had a special power to teleport them to give his slave the atvantage. So he didn't fight at all. Pyu-Pyu was defeated easily with a simple blast from Vegita. They went to the next arena. It was a monster named Yacon. He had very sharp claws. He also eats light and is from the planet of Darkness. Gokou couldn't see. He had an idea. So he turn Super Saiyjin to produce light. But he didn't know that Yacon can absorb light. Supreme Kai explained how and what Yacon did. Then Gohan told Gokou not to go SSJ. Gokou had an idea. He went SSJ. He powered up to stay SSJ. Then Yacon absorbed to much energy. Then he exploded.The room went back to normal and went down to the lower level. There they waited for awhile. The reason was because Dabura was meditating his power. They also aren't allowed to blow up the ship or Majin Buu will come within his deep sleep. As they wait in the Martial Arts Tournament, 18 wins. Really Hercule does because 18 wanted more prize money so she made a skam. Then Dabura the Demon King came in. It was Gohan's turn. Babidi gave him the atvantage by making the room from the Demon World. Gohan was confident. After several attacks, Gohan knew he must go SSJ2. He powered up and attacked. After along time of battle. Dabura figured Gohan's very strong so he takes out a sword. He had two big chances of killing Gohan with it. Vegita complained about Gohan taking so long. He knew he could take Dabura out in a sinch. Gokou on the other hand kept saying give him a chance. After awhile Dabura corners Gohan, and with one slash he could have killed him, but Gohan grabbed the sword and broke it. Dabura noticed Vegita. The way and the words he was saying showed that Vegita had no pure heart. Dabura tells Babidi he has something important to tell him. As he withdrawed. "Babidi asked what is it Dabura?" Babidi thought he made an excuse from the battle. But when he figures out what Dabura wanted, he wasn't going kill Dabura after all. What they were going to do is turn Vegita Majin. He was tooken over. Then Babidi teleported them to the compitition. Gokou wouldn't fight Vegita. So Vegita exploded the one side of the stadium. Gokou was furious. Gokou was going to ask Babidi to change the arena. Before they battled or teleported, Supreme Kai got in the way of Gokou. He said he'll have to kill him. Supreme Kai stood there. Gokou said fine and asked Babidi to take them to a place that looks like where Cell battled. Vegita powered up, same with Gokou. Then they fought. It was one of the greatest battles. Gokou could've went SSJ3, but he didn't want to kill Vegita. Later Gohan and The Supreme Kai and Gohan struggled to blow up the door, knowing they could wake Majin Buu. To continue down Babidi's spaceship they were in the last room. Gohan easily knocked out each person by powering up. They went further into the ship. Now they found Dabura and Babidi. He also changed the arena not to far from where Gokou was fighting. Babidi made Majin Buu come out. But, Gohan tried to stop it by shooting Kame-Hame-has. But they failed except one. It knocked it off it's platform. Later, Goten and Chibi Trunks arrived where the Majin Buu scene. They saw Piccolo and Krillin. But, Trunks had to touch Piccolo and he broke, but then he regenerayed himself. Dabura was killed by Majin Buu. Majin Buu turned him into a cookie. Now Krillin and piccolo are back to normal. Majin buu was a pink, fat fellow. He was fat because the last time he appeared he absorbed one of the Kais. Earlier Vegita knocks Gokou out and takes a Senzu Bean. He took off to fight Majin Buu. Back to the scene. We find out that Gohan and Kaioshen both get knocked out by Buu. Later, Vegita arrives. Vegita fights Majin Buu for alittle. While they were battling Piccolo almost killed Babidi. He had only his body and one arm and a head. When, Vegita was hurt. Goten and Trunks came to help. Vegita knew he would lose. So, he knocked out Goten and Trunks so they wouldn't have to see him die. He decided to self-destruced. Piccolo saves Goten and Trunks. They all think Buu died. But, he survived. Krillin and Piccolo are upset. Piccolo tells Krillin to take Goten and Trunks. Piccolo goes to the explosion. He found Babidi. Piccolo was going to kill him until all these little Majin Buus formed Buu. He managed to escape. Babidi asked Buu to help him. Buu said,"no." until Babidi said,"Buu I'm the only one that could release you if your sealed up again!" Buu fixed Babidi. Babidi and Buu flew around cities terrarizing them. Piccolo and Krillin goes to Dende's lookout. They set them on a bed. Back at the tournament the decided to look for the DragonBalls. They found them. Gokou woke up. He went to Dende's lookout. Gokou talked over how they might be able to fuse Goten and Trunks. Gokou can't fuse because you have to be very similar. Bulma and them made a wish for all people killed by Vegita. Gokou came to them trying to stop them so they saved the last wish. Goten and Trunks wake up. Earlier as I was explaining all of that. Supreme Kai looks for Gohan despratly. Thinking he could save the Universe. He found them. When Bulma made the wish Kibito was wished back. So he healed them. And they took Gohan to Supreme Kai's Planet. There they looked for the Z sword. No one could pull it out. And Kibito worring that Gohan is disrespecting Supreme Kai wearing beat up clothes. The Z sword was stuck in a stone. It was so hard to pull out Gohan had to go SSJ2. He pulled out. The sword was stuck in so deep it wasn't able to be pulled out.

To be continued.
