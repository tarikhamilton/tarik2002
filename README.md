# Tarik's Dragonball, Z, and GT Legend

This is a port of my first website I ever made, back before I wrote my first `<div>` tag: 
[https://www.angelfire.com/anime3/tarik2002/](https://www.angelfire.com/anime3/tarik2002/)

The entire contents of the site have been manually translated to Markdown and turned into a [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) project.

## What Works

I was able to get all text and images for each page, and even preserved the routing and paths, which all ended in `.html` and started at the root, despite hierarchical content.

What didn't make it were the Angelfire banner ads, Java Chat applet, polls, and the visitor counter.

## History

It seems like the first few months of 2002 I started working on a Dragon Ball Z site to catalog my art, cool images, and to dispense Dragon Ball knowledge. I remember a lot of awesome table-based layout Dragon Ball Z sites that were largely just lists of information based on lore. That is probably where some of the content came from, as well as the inspiration.

My best friend in the About Me section introduced me to the internet, DBZ, lifting, and so much more. He passed away on July 18, 2020. You can see in the last update, I abandoned the project to work on a site together with him on Freewebz, which *is* dead. This is one of the few ancient artifacts from my time on Earth with him. I have no idea why Angelfire is still up, but **thank you!**

## Development

It's a Node application, so just clone, install, and run `yarn start`.
